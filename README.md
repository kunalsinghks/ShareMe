- **📱 One-Scan Mobile Sharing**: Built-in QR Code generator lets you share 4K movies or massive folders to mobile devices in seconds.
- **� Secure Vault Mode**: Add a global access password to your workspace with one click.
- **� Luxury Dashboard**: A modern, light/dark mode neumorphic UI designed for simplicity and elegance.
- **📥 Tray-Active Engine**: Minimize to the system tray to keep your links alive while you work.
